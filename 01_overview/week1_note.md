1. Textbooks
* Computer systems: A Programmer's Perspective
* The C Programming Language, Second Edition
2. Ints are not Intergers, Floats are not Reals
*  ./sq 50000
*  ./fsum 1e20 -1e20 + 3.14
*  ./fsum 1e20 3.14 -1e20
3. shift
* shift_amount mod word_size
2. Logic Operations
* 0 as Flase
* nonzero as True
* Early termination
3. p && *p (avoids null pointer acess)
4. mix of unsigned and signed
* signed valu implicitly cast to unsigned
5. Expandingunsigned: zeros added
* signed: sin extension(ones)
6. Truncatng
* unsigned/signed: bits are truncated(top k bits)
* unsigned: mod operation
* sigimilar to mod
